&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a Research Faculty at the [Hawai ªi Institute of Marine Biology](http://www.himb.hawaii.edu/), working in the [ToBo (Toonen/Bowen) laboratory](http://tobolab.org/people/postdoctoral-researchers/zach-forsman/). I am interested in using molecular and ecological data to support conservation.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reef building corals are a fascinating and challenging model system. They are an ancient and diverse lineage, that form the foundation of a rapidly declining ecosystem. Corals form a unique partnership with symbiotic algae that breaks down during marine heat waves, leading to coral bleaching and mortality.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coral reefs provide essential habitat for fisheries, shoreline protection, sand for beaches, and home to up to 1/4 of marine life. Mass bleaching events have resulted in major declines of reefs globally, and these ecosystems are at the frontlines of climate change.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can we maintain and preserve coral reefs for future generations?

I use genetic and ecological tools for applied conservation. Here are some research highlights:

### Genetic studies:

- Which species are endanger of going extinct?
-- I use genetic data to support conservation of corals, plants, and invertebrates.
- How are species and populations related?
-- Genetic studies provide a 'map' of genetic relationships, revealing new species and hidden patterns of biodiversity.
- Will corals be able to adapt?  
-- We have found surprising genetic structure and evidence of recent adaptation across habitats.
-- Genomic data is revealing rapid adaptation and host-symbiont co-evolution.


### Restoration ecology:
- Can we cultivate and 'mass produce' coral?
-- The [micro-fragmentation method](https://peerj.com/articles/1313/) results in rapid tissue growth; a key method for reef restoration and conservation research.
-- The method is used at the [DAR Coral Restoration Nursery](https://dlnr.hawaii.gov/blog/2016/02/11/nr16-30/) to produce large coral covered modules.
-- Coral micro-fragments can also be used as a biological assay.
- Can we cultivate a whole coral reef?
-- The [HIMB Coral Nursery](/himb-coral-nursery) is a floating cultivated reef, built from rescued corals and recycled material.

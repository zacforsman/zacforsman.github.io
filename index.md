&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am an evolutionary biologist and ecologist working at the [Hawai ªi Institute of Marine Biology](http://www.himb.hawaii.edu/), in the [ToBo (Toonen/Bowen) laboratory](http://tobolab.org/people/postdoctoral-researchers/zach-forsman/). I am interested in using molecular tools to learn about evolution and biodiversity. Reef building corals are a fascinating and challenging model system because they form the foundation of a threatened and rapidly declining ecosystem. They are an ancient and diverse lineage ancestral to most metazoans, and they form a unique partnership with symbiotic algae. Marine heat waves cause this partnership to break down, leading to coral bleaching and decline.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coral reefs provide essential habitat for fisheries, shoreline protection, sand for beaches, and home to up to 1/4 of marine life. Mass bleaching events have resulted in major declines of reefs globally, and these ecosystems are at the frontlines of climate change.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can we maintain and preserve coral reefs for future generations?



## Career highlights:
### Evolutionary Biology:
- Genomic data revealed rapid adaptation and host-symbiont co-evolution.
- Discovered new species and hidden patterns of biodiversity.
- Surprising genetic structure and rapid adaptation across habitats.
- Genetic data guided ESA listings and supported conservation of corals, plants, and invertebrates.

### Reef restoration:
- Co-discovered and described the [micro-fragmentation method](https://peerj.com/articles/1313/), a coral cultivation method for reef restoration and conservation research.
- Worked to establish the [DAR Coral Restoration Nursery](https://dlnr.hawaii.gov/blog/2016/02/11/nr16-30/)
- Worked to establish the [HIMB Coral Nursery](/himb-coral-nursery)

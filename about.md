I am an evolutionary biologist and ecologist working at the [Hawai ªi Institute of Marine Biology](http://www.himb.hawaii.edu/), in the [ToBo (Toonen/Bowen) laboratory](http://tobolab.org/people/postdoctoral-researchers/zach-forsman/). I am interested in using molecular tools to learn about evolution and biodiversity. Reef building corals are a fascinating and challenging model system because they form the foundation of a threated and rapidly declining ecosystem. They are an ancient and diverse lineage ancestral to most metazoans, and they form a unique partnership with symbiotic algae. Marine heat waves cause this partnership to break down, leading to coral bleaching and decline.

Coral reefs provide essential habitat for fisheries, shoreline protection, sand for beaches, and home to up to 1/4 of marine life. Mass bleaching events have resulted in major declines of reefs globally, and these ecosystems are at the frontlines of climate change. Can we maintain and preserve coral reefs for future generations?



## Career highlights:
### Evolutionary Biology:
- Genomic tools revealed rapid adaptation and host-symbiont co-evolution
- New species and hidden patterns of biodiversity discovered
- Genetic structure across habitats
- Genetic data to guide ESA listings

### Reef restoration:
- Co-discovered the micro-fragmentation method, a coral cultivation method for reef restoration.
- Worked to establish the DAR Coral Restoration Nursery.
- Worked to establish the [HIMB Coral Nursery](/HIMB_Coral_Nursery/)

The HIMB Coral Nursery is currently an unfunded volunteer effort, a pilot project to determine if it is possible to effectively farm coral and improve reef restoration in a floating midwater coral nursery.  

The nursery was constructed in 2017 from recycled dolphin and fish pens that were decommissioned. Corals had naturally settled on the nets of these pens over the course of approximately 10 years, these corals were rescued with the assistance and guidance of the State of Hawai ªi Division of Aquatic Resources.

The pilot project has been successful, with racks of coral increasing in coral cover from approximately %50 in 2017 to up to 100% for many of the racks in 2020, despite a summer bleaching event (Figure 1a,b).  We have documented recruitment of juvenile fish (McGilly 2019) and coral (Figure 1c). The HIMB nursery has also enabled dozens of student research projects.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a Research Faculty at the [Hawai ªi Institute of Marine Biology](http://www.himb.hawaii.edu/), working in the [ToBo (Toonen/Bowen) laboratory](http://tobolab.org/people/postdoctoral-researchers/zach-forsman/). I am interested in using molecular and ecological data to support conservation.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reef building corals are a fascinating and challenging to study. They are an ancient and diverse lineage, and are the foundation of an ecosystem that provides essential habitat for fisheries, shoreline protection, sand for beaches, and home to up to 1/4 of marine life.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unique partnership between corals and symbiotic algae makes coral reefs possible, but marine heatwaves cause this partnership to break down. Corals without algae are 'bleached' stark white and will likely die. Marine heatwaves are causing more and more mass bleaching events, and major declines of reefs globally.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Can we maintain and preserve coral reefs for future generations?***

I use genetic and ecological tools for applied conservation. Here are some research highlights:

### Genetic studies:

- ***Which species are endanger of going extinct?***  Genetic data supports conservation of corals, plants, and invertebrates.
- ***How are species and populations related?*** DNA provides a 'map' of relationships, revealing new species and hidden patterns of biodiversity.
- ***Will corals be able to adapt?*** Recent divergence across habitats, suggests rapid adaptation. Corals have extraordinary variation, the raw material for natural selection. Many lineages have unique adaptations and will survive but coral reefs and the ecosystems they support are collapsing at alarming rates.

### Restoration ecology:
- ***Can we cultivate and 'mass produce' coral?*** The [micro-fragmentation method](https://peerj.com/articles/1313/) results in rapid tissue growth; a key method for reef restoration and conservation research. The method is used at the [DAR Coral Restoration Nursery](https://dlnr.hawaii.gov/blog/2016/02/11/nr16-30/) to produce large coral covered modules. Coral micro-fragments can also be used as a biological assay.




- ***Can we cultivate a coral reef?*** The [HIMB Coral Nursery](/himb-coral-nursery) is a floating cultivated reef, built from rescued corals and recycled material. Our goal is to use ecological data to prevent reef decline and promote restoration.

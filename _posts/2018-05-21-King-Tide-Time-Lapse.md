This is a time-lapse video of coral reef in Hawaii during the king tides. The king tides occur when the moon and the sun align to have maximum gravitational pull. The coral reef is exposed to the air as the tides rise and fall. Time-lapse reveals that the oceans pulse, almost like breathing, yet humans can not perceive the 'breath' of the ocean due to our sense of time. The ocean and the many creatures that live in it (some of them are our ancestors) have been experiencing these cycles for billions of years.

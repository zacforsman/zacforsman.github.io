&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a Research Faculty at the [Hawai ªi Institute of Marine Biology](http://www.himb.hawaii.edu/), working in the [ToBo (Toonen/Bowen) laboratory](http://tobolab.org/people/postdoctoral-researchers/zach-forsman/). I am interested in using molecular and ecological data to support conservation.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reef building corals are a fascinating and challenging system to study. They are an ancient and diverse lineage, and are the foundation of an ecosystem that provides essential habitat for fisheries, sand for beaches and protection for shorelines, and home to up to 1/4 of marine life.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coral reefs are made possible by a unique partnership between corals and symbiotic algae that can breakdown during [increasingly frequent marine heatwaves](https://coralreefwatch.noaa.gov/satellite/index.php), which leaves corals 'bleached' stark white with no algae and vulnerable to disease and mortality. Marine heatwaves are causing alarming mass bleaching events, and major declines of reefs globally.

<p style="text-align: center; font-size:2vw;">Can we maintain and preserve coral reefs for future generations?</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> I use genetic and ecological tools for applied conservation. Here are some highlights:</p>

  Which species are at risk of extinction?
  </b>  
  <br><br>
  Genetic data supports conservation of corals, plants, and invertebrates.  
  <br><br>

  <b> How are species and populations related? </b>
  <br><br>

  DNA provides a 'map' of relationships, revealing new species and hidden patterns of biodiversity.
   <br><br>
    <i>e.g</i> Forsman ZH, Barshis D, Hunter CL, Toonen RJ (2009) Shape-shifting corals: Molecular markers show morphology is evolutionarily plastic in <i>Porites</i>. <a href="https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2148-9-45"> BMC Evolutionary Biology 9:45</a>

  <b> Will corals be able to adapt? </b>
 <br>
  Recent divergence across habitats, suggests rapid adaptation. Work is urgently needed to understand these extraordinary patterns of variation.
 <br><br>
 <i>e.g.</i> Tisthammer KH, Forsman ZH, Toonen RJ, Richmond RH (2020) Genetic structure is stronger across human-impacted habitats than among islands in the coral <i>Porites lobata </i>. <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/8550/"> PeerJ</a>

  <b> How fast can we grow coral? </b>
  <br>
  The <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/1313/"> micro-fragmentation method </a> results in rapid tissue growth; a key method for reef restoration and conservation research. The method is used at the <a href="https://dlnr.hawaii.gov/blog/2016/02/11/nr16-30/">DAR Coral Restoration Nursery </a> to produce large coral covered modules. Coral micro-fragments can also be used as a biological assay.

  <b> Can we mass produce coral covered structures? </b>  
 <br>
  The <a href="https://thebiologist.rsb.org.uk/biologist-features/158-biologist/features/2278-divide-and-conquer"> micro-fragmentation method </a> can be used to rapidly cover substrates with coral tissue. Can this method be used to mass produce coral seedlings, or to turn artificial breakwaters from 'gray' to 'blue' infrastructure?

  <b> Can we cultivate a floating coral reef? </b>  
  <br>
  The <a href="/himb-coral-nursery">HIMB Coral Nursery</a> is a floating coral reef, built from naturally settled corals rescued from recycled dolphin and aquaculture pens. Our goal is to use ecological data to prevent reef decline and promote restoration.

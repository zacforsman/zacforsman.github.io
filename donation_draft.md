HIMB Coral Nursery Related Studies at HIMB

The goal of the Hawai ªi Institute of Marine Biology (HIMB) Coral Nursery is to support coral reef research. Improving methods for coral cultivation, reef restoration, and understanding ecological interactions that promote coral growth are of particular interest.

The HIMB Coral Nursery consists of rescued corals that naturally settled on dolphin and fish pens that were decommissioned, recycled, and repurposed to form a platform for coral cultivation and research. This floating midwater nursery contains over 100m2 of corals and diverse invertebrates and fish -- a floating coral reef that is rapidly growing. Donations will support the maintenance and renovation of the nursery, as well as research at the undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral level.
